# Federated Server Configuration
# ================================
# Configuration for the central federated learning server.
# This file is loaded by ServerConfig.from_yaml()

# Minimum number of clients before aggregation
min_clients: 2

# Timeout for a round (seconds)
# If fewer than min_clients submit but timeout is reached,
# aggregation proceeds with available updates.
round_timeout_sec: 300.0

# Timeout before marking a device as stale (seconds)
stale_device_timeout_sec: 120.0

# Initial model weights path (optional)
# If not specified, model starts with random weights.

# Directory for ONNX model exports
# Each aggregation produces a versioned ONNX file here.

# Model architecture configuration
# These are passed to the STGNN constructor.
